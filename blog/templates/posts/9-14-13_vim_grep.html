    So today, I needed to perform a basic find and replace across many (hundreds) of files.
    In Vim, it is easy to replace all instances of <code>foo</code> with <code>bar</code> is as simple as
</p>
<pre><code>:%s/foo/bar/g</code></pre>
<p>
    However, this is only within one file, so to perform this action on multiple files, you need to use the arglist.
    {% if summary %}<a href="{{ entry.get_absolute_url }}">Continue Reading...</a>{% endif %}
</p>
{% if not summary %}
<p>
    If you start vim from the command line with files as an argument, those files are automatically added to the arglist.
    You can also add to the arglist using the command <code>:argadd</code> from inside Vim, but the problem with that is adding
    to the arglist manually like that is annoying when you have a lot of files that also can't be added using standard pattern matching and wildcards, (e.g., <code>path/to/files/*.html</code>).
</p>

<p>
    The beauty of the arglist is that once you have all the files you want in it, you can then do
</p>
<pre><code>:argdo %s/foo/bar/g | update!</code></pre>
<p>
    The <strong>argdo</strong> will perform whichever command that follows on each file in the arglist.
    The argdo command however does not write and save the file which is what the following update command is for.
    The bang, of course, forces it to save.
</p>

<p>
    I knew that I could <strong>grep</strong> for the term that I wanted to replace and end up with a list of the files containing this
    term by passing the <code>-l</code> flag. So I started looking into how I could get that list into the arglist in Vim.
</p>

<p>
    You can't just simply pipe the output of the <strong>grep</strong> into the <strong>vim</strong> command, but luckily Unix also has the
    <strong>xargs</strong> which can turn the <strong>grep</strong> output into arguments. This means that you can do
</p>
<pre><code>grep -l foo | xargs vim</code></pre>
<p>
    and then boom, you have every file which includes the term you need to replace in the arglist, and then
</p>
<pre><code>:argdo %s/foo/bar/g | update!</code></pre>
<p>
    will flip through and replace every instance of <code>foo</code> you have.
</p>
