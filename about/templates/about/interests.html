<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I have a wide array of interests that range from crocheting to movies,
and sports to computers. Many of my interests will come through in my
<a href="{% url 'blog_index' %}">Blog</a> posts, but you'll be able to find
a few details about my interests here.</p>

<p>I used to play hockey for the Northern Colorado Youth Hockey club, and
also used to be a huge fan of the Colorado Eagles minor league hockey team.
Unfortunately, when I moved away to college, I wasn't able to continue playing
or attend many games and I've lost interest. Now, I mostly just follow the NFL,
with my favorite team being the Atlanta Falcons. Rise up!</p>

<p>My main sources of entertainment tend to be TV, movies, and video games.
I may put up a list of movies and TV shows that I enjoy, but that will
probably be better served by a blog post or two, which will also allow me
to discuss them as well. You can find the games I have played recently below.</p>
